## Hello 👋
👩‍💻**ABOUT ME**

PhD candidate in Environmental Engineering specializing in water quality, data analytics, and risk modeling. Experienced in developing national-scale water quality databases, evaluating contaminants under the SDWA (EPA), and applying geospatial and statistical tools (R, ArcGIS Pro) to support regulatory and infrastructure decision-making. Skilled in translating complex environmental data into actionable insights for public health protection and policy improvement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔭 **Current Research**

I’m currently researching drinking water quality and public health risks. My work focuses on modeling risk and exposure using large-scale water system data (6YR, UCMR, IRIS, Census), R programming and geospatial analysis to identify environmental injustices and support more equitable water management solutions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🌱 **Currently Learning**

I’m currently learning advanced multilevel modeling, regression, and the more advanced R programming language to enhance the quality and professionalism of my research.

⚡ **Fun fact**

A fun fact about me is that when I have a responsibility or a project in progress, it becomes my top priority. I stay focused until I'm confident everything is on track and completed well before the deadline!
